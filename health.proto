 * The default health levels are:
 * - OK (green): no problems detected
 * - WARNING (orange): unresolvable problems detected, for example delayed or skipped messages
 * - ERROR (red): significant problems detected (that typically can be resolved),
 *   for example inactivity or invalid messages (resolved on a successful message)
 *
 * Health levels can be customized to as many as you need for your operations, for example:
 * - INTERVENTION
 * - DEFECT
 * - BATTERY
 * - HIGH
 * - LOW
 *
 * Health levels are ordered by severity (low to high), and only the most severe level will be returned when
 * retrieving a modem.
 *
 * Health can be assigned using modems alarms, which specify the health level they will cause on a modem (and for how
 * long, if it does not resolve automatically).
 *
 * Precisely one health level can be assigned as a catch-all for any unknown health levels from alarms (or Hiber systems),
 * which can happen when a device manufacturer has provided alarms to your device (e.g. a low battery alarm).
 * By default, any unknown health levels map to the level that is marked catch-all.
