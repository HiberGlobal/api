/* A file in your organization, with its mime-type and name.
 * It can represent any file of any type.
 *
 * Specific API calls may pur restrictions on the name or size of the file.
 *
 * To avoid sending large amounts of binary data, File does not typically contain the file's content.
 * The content can be fetched at a url, or using the FileService.Get rpc.
 * For specific use cases, the data field might be set with binary data, avoiding the need for another lookup.
 *
 * The file name should be interpreted as-is.
 * No hierarchical information is stored in the name, nor should you look at the "extension" to know its media-type.
 * It might not even have a file extension.
 * The file name may contain characters that cannot be a valid file name on certain systems.
 *
 * When showing this as an image in a browser, one can make use of a `data` URI.
 * The client must convert the bytes to base64 and can then construct a data URI like this
 *
 *     data:<media-type>;base64,<base64-encoded-bytes>
 *
 * Other type clients should be able to sort-of-directly set the data bytes as the source for an image.
 *
 * (Technical note: the indices are structured for binary backwards compatibility with the now-removed NamedFile.)
