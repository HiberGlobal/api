## ModemTransferReturnService


### Prepare
> **rpc** Prepare([PrepareModemForReturnRequest](#preparemodemforreturnrequest))
    [PrepareModemForReturnRequest.Response](#preparemodemforreturnrequestresponse)

If any problems are detected with the modems within the return period, mark them using this method.
Modems marked using this method can be returned in one transfer, as long as they are returned to the same
organization.

### Lines
> **rpc** Lines([ListModemTransferReturnLinesRequest](#listmodemtransferreturnlinesrequest))
    [ListModemTransferReturnLinesRequest.Response](#listmodemtransferreturnlinesrequestresponse)

List the return lines, either for a return transfer, or lines that have not been
returned with a return transfer yet.

### DeleteLine
> **rpc** DeleteLine([DeleteModemTransferReturnLinesRequest](#deletemodemtransferreturnlinesrequest))
    [DeleteModemTransferReturnLinesRequest.Response](#deletemodemtransferreturnlinesrequestresponse)



### Send
> **rpc** Send([SendReturnRequest](#sendreturnrequest))
    [SendReturnRequest.Response](#sendreturnrequestresponse)

Transfer modems marked for return back to the sender.



## ModemTransferService
Tracking services for transferring modems between parties.
Modems can be transferred between organizations for any number of reason, ranging from actually shipping to a different
company to handing them over to a third party for installation.

### Transfer
> **rpc** Transfer([TransferModemsRequest](#transfermodemsrequest))
    [TransferModemsRequest.Response](#transfermodemsrequestresponse)

Transfer modems to a different organization.
As a result, the modem will get the outbound status for you, and the inbound status for the recipient.
Note: this call can automatically generate a child organization for the recipient if it has no organization.

### List
> **rpc** List([ListModemTransfersRequest](#listmodemtransfersrequest))
    [ListModemTransfersRequest.Response](#listmodemtransfersrequestresponse)

List transfers for modems. This could be used to list all active transfers on a selection of modems,
or, for example, to list this history of all transfers for one modem.

### Cancel
> **rpc** Cancel([CancelModemTransferRequest](#cancelmodemtransferrequest))
    [CancelModemTransferRequest.Response](#cancelmodemtransferrequestresponse)

Cancel a started transfer.

### Received
> **rpc** Received([ReceivedModemTransferRequest](#receivedmodemtransferrequest))
    [ReceivedModemTransferRequest.Response](#receivedmodemtransferrequestresponse)

Mark inbound modems as received, adding them to your organization.

### NotReceived
> **rpc** NotReceived([NotReceivedModemTransferRequest](#notreceivedmodemtransferrequest))
    [NotReceivedModemTransferRequest.Response](#notreceivedmodemtransferrequestresponse)

Mark modems as not received when they were inbound but did not show up.
If you do receive the modems after marking them as not received, you can claim them to still get them in
your organization.

### TransferModemsRequest.DataTransferMode
What to do with the messages, events and other related data.

| Name | Description | Number |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| UNKNOWN | The API Will reject any request without an explicitly set DataTransferMode. | 0 |
| DELETE_DATA | Exclude messages and all events. The data will be deleted. | 1 |

### TransferModemsRequest.GatewayTransferMode
What to do with external devices on transferring a gateway.
This mode is evaluated twice: once when the transfer is created and once when the transfer is finalised.
When creating, a double check is done on whether or not your transfer contains gateways or external devices.
When finalising, the actual state of currently connected external devices is determined.
Note: Any *new* external devices that start transmitting after starting the transfer will be processed as well.

| Name | Description | Number |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| NOTHING_SELECTED | Signifies that no selection has been made. This is not allowed for gateways, the client must explicitly choose what happens to external devices. | 0 |
| ORPHAN_EXTERNAL_DEVICES | When transferring a gateway, *orphan* all external devices. The devices are re-created in the recipient organization when they transmit through the gateway. The old modem is unchanged, but can no longer receive new messages, unless it is connected to another gateway in the sender organization. Old messages from the modem remain in the sender organization under its old modem number. | 1 |
| DELETE_EXTERNAL_DEVICES | When transferring a gateway, mark all external devices as *DEAD*. The devices are re-created in the recipient organization when they transmit through the gateway. Old messages from this device remain in the sender organization under its old modem, which is marked DEAD. DEAD modems are be automatically hidden, but can still be accessed. | 2 |
| TRANSFER_EXTERNAL_DEVICES | When transferring a gateway, *transfer* all external devices together with the gateway. This moves all existing external devices with the gateway, while they keep their modem number and messages. Old messages from this device will be available to the new owner. | 3 |

### hiber.Area

Rectangular area between two locations, normalized to bottom-left and top-right points.

Center point is added for convenience; it's simple the point directly between the two corner points.
When sending an Area to the api, the center location is ignored.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| center | [ hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) | none |
| bottom_left | [ hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) | none |
| top_right | [ hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) | none |

### hiber.Avatar

An avatar is represented either by a (publicly) fetchable URL that serves an image,
xor a binary payload that knows its name and mime-type.

If it is a url, it must be obtainable without credentials, though this is not validated by the API.
Because the content behind URL's can change or become unavailable over time,
the client should make sure it properly caches the data fetched from the URL.
("Properly" means [among other things] respecting the response headers for this resource)

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| [**oneof**](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#oneof) **url_or_image**.url | [ string](#string) | A URL that contains the location of avatar. |

### hiber.BytesOrHex

Some clients may prefer direct binary data, while other prefer a hexadecimal string,
both for input and output. To support both methods, this object is used to represent binary data.

When you receive this from the api, both fields are set. When sending it to the api, only one field is required.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| bytes | [ bytes](#bytes) | none |
| hex | [ string](#string) | none |

### hiber.Date

Date type for convenience.

Some clients are better at parsing year, month and day of month as separate fields,
while others prefer a text-based format.
To accommodate this, this Date type supports both.

When used as API output, both the int fields and textual fields will be set.
The textual field has the commonly used ISO 8601 local date format (i.e. "2018-01-01").
When used an API input, either specify the int fields or the textual field.
If both are specified, the textual field will be discarded.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

"Exclude" fields filter out anything in the exclude set.
When combined with include, exclude takes precedence when determining whether an item is filtered


### hiber.Filter.ChildOrganizations

Specify which organizations to get data from. By default, data is only retrieved for the current organization,
but using ChildOrganizations we can specify to include a number of, or all, sub-organizations.

Note: ChildOrganization differs from other filters in that it defaults to not allowing anything, where the
other filters default to allowing everything

| shapes | [repeated hiber.Shape](#hibershape) | Polygon shapes, each defined by a list of locations, which draw a shape on the map. |

### hiber.MapFilter

Some properties are stored as a name-value pair (e.g. bluetooth: 4.0, bluetooth: BLE).
This filter allows selecting a range of values for a specific name.
One could imagine wanting to include "all devices with bluetooth 4.0 or 4.1".

To select for multiple versions of a property,
add the name of the property as a map-key and add a repeated list of versions as the map-value.

For example:
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }
    returns all items that have any version of bluetooth,
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ '4.0', '5.0' ] }
    will only return items that have bluetooth version 4.0 _or_ 5.0 (inclusive or),
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ '' ] }
    would only select bluetooth peripherals that don't have any version set,
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ], 'LoRaWAN' -> [ ] }
    will only select items that have both bluetooth (any version) _and_ LoRaWAN (any version),
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }, exclude { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }
    will return an empty list since exclude will take precedence, and
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }, exclude { 'bluetooth' -> [ '3.0' ] }
    returns only items that have bluetooth, but not version 3.0.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| include_and | [map hiber.MapFilter.IncludeAndEntry](#hibermapfilterincludeandentry) | Filter to only include items with all of the given set of properties. |
| exclude | [map hiber.MapFilter.ExcludeEntry](#hibermapfilterexcludeentry) | Filter to exclude items with any of the given set of properties. |

### hiber.NamedFile

A NamedFile contains bytes with its mime-type and name.
It can represent any file of any type.

Note that depending on where in the API this is used,
the server might put restrictions on file size, media-type or name length.

The file name should be interpreted as-is.
No hierarchical information is stored in the name, nor should you look at the "extension" to know its media-type.
It might not even have a file extension.
The file name may contain characters that cannot be a valid file name on certain systems.

Specific API calls may pur restrictions on the name or size of the file.

When showing this as an image in a browser, one can make use of a `data` URI.
The client must convert the bytes to base64 and can then construct a data URI like this

    data:<media-type>;base64,<base64-encoded-bytes>

Other type clients should be able to sort-of-directly set the data bytes as the source for an image.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| data | [ hiber.BytesOrHex](#hiberbytesorhex) | The binary payload that represents the file |
| media_type | [ string](#string) | The media-type of the file, as defined by RFC 6838 or its extensions |
| name | [ string](#string) | A semantic name for this file. |

### hiber.Pagination

Pagination is normalized across the api. Provide a pagination object to get a specific page or offset,
or limit your data.

Calls that have a pagination option automatically return a Pagination.Result, which contains
either the specified pagination options or the defaults, as well as total counts. It also contains Pagination
objects that can be used for the previous and next page.

This effectively means that an api user would never need to create their own pagination object; as long as they
start at the first page and continue to the next, they can use the provided Pagination object.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| size | [ int32](#int32) | none |
| page | [ int32](#int32) | none |

### hiber.Pagination.Result



| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| size | [ int32](#int32) | none |
| page | [ int32](#int32) | none |
| total | [ int32](#int32) | none |
| total_pages | [ int32](#int32) | none |
| previous | [ hiber.Pagination](#hiberpagination) | none |
| next | [ hiber.Pagination](#hiberpagination) | none |
| approximated_total | [ bool](#bool) | Indicates that the total is an approximation, and not an exact value. This can be set for data that changes often, or is generally only fetched in an infinite scrolling manner. For example, unbundled events are likely to return an approximated total, but not guaranteed to do so. |

### hiber.Shape

Polygon shape defined by a list of locations, which draw a shape on the map.
The last point is connected to the first to close the shape.

For example, the outline of a city would be defined using a Shape,
while a rectangular region is easier to define using Area.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| path | [repeated hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) | none |
| textual | [ string](#string) | Text representation. Can be used as an alternative input in a request, filled in by the API in responses. |

### hiber.TimeRange

Period of time between two timestamps. Typically used for filtering.

This can be used with textual shortcuts for timestamp, and some additional duration textual shortcuts:
- a duration as an offset of now, i.e. "-10h" or "PT-10h": converted to now + offset, so start.textual -10h is
  10 hours before the end time (using the ISO 8601 duration format)
Examples:
- start "-10h" end "now": a time range from 10 hours before the request time, to the request time
- start "-10h" end "2022-01-01 20:00": becomes start 2022-01-01 10:00 end 2022-01-01 20:00

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| start | [ hiber.Timestamp](#hibertimestamp) | none |
| end | [ hiber.Timestamp](#hibertimestamp) | none |

### hiber.Timestamp

Timestamp type for convenience.

Some clients are better at parsing Google's seconds/nanos based timestamp, while others prefer a text-based format.
To accommodate this, this Timestamp type supports both.

When used as API output, both the timestamp and textual fields will be set. The textual field has the commonly
used ISO 8601 format (i.e. "2018-01-01T13:00:00Z").
When used an API input, only one of the fields is needed, there is no need to set both. When both are set, the
timestamp field will be used, the textual field will be discarded.

In addition, the textual field, when used as input, allows for a number of shortcuts that get converted into
timestamps:
- "now": converted to the current timestamp at the time of the request

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| timestamp | [ google.protobuf.Timestamp](#googleprotobuftimestamp) | none |
| time_zone | [ string](#string) | none |
| textual | [ string](#string) | none |

### hiber.UpdateBoolean

Update object for a boolean.

Since false is the default value, we need to distinguish between an omitted value and setting the value to false,
in an update object.

To use this to update, set a value and set updated to true

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) | none |
| value | [ bool](#bool) | none |

### hiber.UpdateClearableString

Update object for a string that can be empty.

Since an empty string is also the default value, we need to distinguish between an omitted value and
setting the value to an empty string, in an update object.

To use this to update, set a value and set updated to true

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) | none |
| value | [ string](#string) | none |

### hiber.UpdateOptionalDuration

Update object for an optional Duration.

To use this to update, set a value and set updated to true.
To clear the duration, set updated to true, but set no value.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) | none |
| value | [ hiber.Duration](#hiberduration) | none |

### hiber.UpdateOptionalId

Update object for an optional id.

To use this to update, set a value and set updated to true. To clear the id, set updated to true, but set no value.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) | none |
| value | [ int64](#int64) | none |

### hiber.UpdateZeroableInt

Update object for an int that can be set to 0.

Since 0 is also the default value, we need to distinguish between an omitted value and setting the value to 0,
in an update object.

To use this to update, set a value and set updated to true

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) | none |
| value | [ uint32](#uint32) | none |
