## Messages

### PushModemMessagesRequest

Push any number of modem messages. These are marked as test messages, which means they will be treated
differently in a few places (e.g. message sequence, to avoid errors on the next real messages).
The message is handled like a real message, it's encrypted as if sent from a modem, then goes through
the decryption process and all relevant events are triggered (including webhooks calls caused by the events).

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **optional** organization | [optional string](#string) | Pick the organization to use (/impersonate). If unset, your default organization is used. |

### Simulation

Simulation settings for this organization.

The simulation settings for an organization can be used to configure some organization-wide setting for
specific simulations, like a default for the number of messages to simulate per enabled modem), or configuring
a percentage of simulated messages to trigger a delayed event.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| organization | [ string](#string) |  |
| enabled | [ bool](#bool) | Whether or not all simulations for this organization are enabled. |
| modem_inactivity | [ Simulation.ModemInactivitySimulation](#simulationmodeminactivitysimulation) | Configuration for simulating modem inactivity. |
| delayed_messages | [ Simulation.DelayedMessageSimulation](#simulationdelayedmessagesimulation) | Configuration for simulating delayed messages. |
| modem_message_simulation_defaults | [ Simulation.ModemMessageSimulation.Defaults](#simulationmodemmessagesimulationdefaults) | Default configuration for the modem message simulation. |
| modem_message_simulation | [ Simulation.ModemMessageSimulation.Summary](#simulationmodemmessagesimulationsummary) | Summary of modems with message simulation. |

### Simulation.DelayedMessageSimulation

Simulate delayed messages.

Requires modems with message simulation.
Adds a random delay between minimum_message_delay and maximum_message_delay to a percentage of messages
generated by the modem message simulation.
The messages themselves are not actually delayed; this just sets the sent time further into the past.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| percentage_of_simulated_messages | [ uint32](#uint32) |  |
| minimum_message_delay | [ hiber.Duration](#hiberduration) |  |

### Simulation.GetRequest



| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **optional** organization | [optional string](#string) | Pick the organization to use (/impersonate). If unset, your default organization is used. |

### Simulation.ModemInactivitySimulation

Simulate modem inactivity randomly.

Requires modems with message simulation.
For all those modems, randomly picks modems up to the configured percentage to be inactive.
Those modems are excluded from the simulation for a period between period_min and period_max.
When a modem is no longer inactive, another modem is randomly picked to be inactive. This allows you to test
inactivity detection, health, etc.

This does not affect messages that are not simulated (like test messages or real messages).

so not all messages listed here are referenced.)

#### This section was generated from [base.proto](https://github.com/HiberGlobal/api/blob/master/base.proto).


### hiber.Area

Rectangular area between two locations, normalized to bottom-left and top-right points.

Center point is added for convenience; it's simple the point directly between the two corner points.
When sending an Area to the api, the center location is ignored.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| center | [ hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) |  |
| bottom_left | [ hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) |  |
| top_right | [ hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) |  |
|  **optional** textual | [optional string](#string) | Text representation. Can be used as an alternative input in a request, filled in by the API in responses. |

### hiber.BytesOrHex

Some clients may prefer direct binary data, while other prefer a hexadecimal string,
both for input and output. To support both methods, this object is used to represent binary data.

When you receive this from the api, both fields are set. When sending it to the api, only one field is required.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **optional** bytes | [optional bytes](#bytes) |  |
|  **optional** hex | [optional string](#string) |  |

### hiber.Date

Date type for convenience.

Some clients are better at parsing year, month and day of month as separate fields,
while others prefer a text-based format.
To accommodate this, this Date type supports both.

When used as API output, both the int fields and textual fields will be set.
The textual field has the commonly used ISO 8601 local date format (e.g. "2018-01-01").
When used an API input, either specify the int fields or the textual field.
If both are specified, the textual field will be discarded.

| Field | Type | Description |

### hiber.Filter

Filters used in many api calls to filter the data sources, results, etc.

"Include" fields filter out anything not in the include set.
When not set, all items will be returned (except excluded items)

"Exclude" fields filter out anything in the exclude set.
When combined with include, exclude takes precedence when determining whether an item is filtered


### hiber.Filter.ChildOrganizations

Specify which organizations to get data from. By default, data is only retrieved for the current organization,
but using ChildOrganizations we can specify to include a number of, or all, sub-organizations.

Note: ChildOrganization differs from other filters in that it defaults to not allowing anything, where the
other filters default to allowing everything

|  **optional** textual | [optional string](#string) | Text representation. Can be used as an alternative input in a request, filled in by the API in responses. |

### hiber.LocationSelection

Selection object for map data.

Also, filter the map data by level and area restriction, to only display a small area at a detailed map level,
for example

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| areas | [repeated hiber.Area](#hiberarea) | Rectangular areas, each defined by two locations, normalized to bottom-left and top-right points. |
| shapes | [repeated hiber.Shape](#hibershape) | Polygon shapes, each defined by a list of locations, which draw a shape on the map. |

### hiber.MapFilter

Some properties are stored as a name-value pair (e.g. bluetooth: 4.0, bluetooth: BLE).
This filter allows selecting a range of values for a specific name.
One could imagine wanting to include "all devices with bluetooth 4.0 or 4.1".

To select for multiple versions of a property,
add the name of the property as a map-key and add a repeated list of versions as the map-value.

For example:
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }
    returns all items that have any version of bluetooth,
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ '4.0', '5.0' ] }
    will only return items that have bluetooth version 4.0 _or_ 5.0 (inclusive or),
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ '' ] }
    would only select bluetooth peripherals that don't have any version set,
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ], 'LoRaWAN' -> [ ] }
    will only select items that have both bluetooth (any version) _and_ LoRaWAN (any version),
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }, exclude { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }
    will return an empty list since exclude will take precedence, and
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }, exclude { 'bluetooth' -> [ '3.0' ] }
    returns only items that have bluetooth, but not version 3.0.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| include_and | [map hiber.MapFilter.IncludeAndEntry](#hibermapfilterincludeandentry) | Filter to only include items with all of the given set of properties. |
| exclude | [map hiber.MapFilter.ExcludeEntry](#hibermapfilterexcludeentry) | Filter to exclude items with any of the given set of properties. |

### hiber.MapFilter.ExcludeEntry

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| key | [ string](#string) |  |
| value | [ hiber.MapFilter.OneOfValues](#hibermapfilteroneofvalues) |  |

### hiber.MapFilter.OneOfValues

which is not possible in protobuf without trickery.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| value | [repeated string](#string) |  |

### hiber.Pagination

Pagination is normalized across the api. Provide a pagination object to get a specific page or offset,
or limit your data.

Calls that have a pagination option automatically return a Pagination.Result, which contains
either the specified pagination options or the defaults, as well as total counts. It also contains Pagination
objects that can be used for the previous and next page.

This effectively means that an api user would never need to create their own pagination object; as long as they
start at the first page and continue to the next, they can use the provided Pagination object.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **optional** size | [optional int32](#int32) |  |
|  **optional** page | [optional int32](#int32) |  |

### hiber.Pagination.Result



| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| size | [ int32](#int32) |  |
| page | [ int32](#int32) |  |
| total | [ int32](#int32) |  |
| total_pages | [ int32](#int32) |  |
| previous | [ hiber.Pagination](#hiberpagination) |  |
| next | [ hiber.Pagination](#hiberpagination) |  |
| approximated_total | [ bool](#bool) | Indicates that the total is an approximation, and not an exact value. This can be set for data that changes often, or is generally only fetched in an infinite scrolling manner. For example, unbundled events are likely to return an approximated total, but not guaranteed to do so. |

### hiber.Shape

Polygon shape defined by a list of locations, which draw a shape on the map.
The last point is connected to the first to close the shape.

For example, the outline of a city would be defined using a Shape,
while a rectangular region is easier to define using Area.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| path | [repeated hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) |  |
|  **optional** textual | [optional string](#string) | Text representation. Can be used as an alternative input in a request, filled in by the API in responses. |

### hiber.TimeRange

Period of time between two timestamps. Typically used for filtering.

This can be used with textual shortcuts for timestamp, and some additional duration textual shortcuts:
- a duration as an offset of now, e.g. "-10h" or "PT-10h": converted to now + offset, so start.textual -10h is
  10 hours before the end time (using the ISO 8601 duration format)
Examples:
- start "-10h" end "now": a time range from 10 hours before the request time, to the request time
- start "-10h" end "2022-01-01 20:00": becomes start 2022-01-01 10:00 end 2022-01-01 20:00

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| start | [ hiber.Timestamp](#hibertimestamp) |  |
| end | [ hiber.Timestamp](#hibertimestamp) |  |

### hiber.Timestamp

Timestamp type for convenience.

Some clients are better at parsing Google's seconds/nanos based timestamp, while others prefer a text-based format.
To accommodate this, this Timestamp type supports both.

When used as API output, both the timestamp and textual fields will be set. The textual field has the commonly
used ISO 8601 format (e.g. "2018-01-01T13:00:00Z").
When used an API input, only one of the fields is needed, there is no need to set both. When both are set, the
timestamp field will be used, the textual field will be discarded.

In addition, the textual field, when used as input, allows for a number of shortcuts that get converted into
timestamps:
- "now": converted to the current timestamp at the time of the request

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **optional** timestamp | [optional google.protobuf.Timestamp](#googleprotobuftimestamp) |  |
|  **optional** time_zone | [optional string](#string) |  |
|  **optional** textual | [optional string](#string) |  |

### hiber.UpdateBoolean

<strong>Deprecated.</strong> Update object for a boolean.

Since false is the default value, we need to distinguish between an omitted value and setting the value to false,
in an update object.

DEPRECATED: use alternative optional fields in the relevant places instead.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) |  |
| value | [ bool](#bool) |  |

### hiber.UpdateClearableString

<strong>Deprecated.</strong> Update object for a string that can be empty.

setting the value to an empty string, in an update object.

To use this to update, set a value and set updated to true

DEPRECATED: use alternative optional fields in the relevant places instead.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) |  |
| value | [ string](#string) |  |

### hiber.UpdateOptionalDuration

<strong>Deprecated.</strong> Update object for an optional Duration.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) |  |
| value | [ hiber.Duration](#hiberduration) |  |

### hiber.UpdateOptionalId

<strong>Deprecated.</strong> Update object for an optional id.

| updated | [ bool](#bool) |  |
| value | [ int64](#int64) |  |

### hiber.UpdateZeroableInt

<strong>Deprecated.</strong> Update object for an int that can be set to 0.

Since 0 is also the default value, we need to distinguish between an omitted value and setting the value to 0,
in an update object.

To use this to update, set a value and set updated to true

DEPRECATED: use alternative optional fields in the relevant places instead.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

## Scalar Value Types

| .proto Type | Notes | C++ Type | Java Type | Python Type |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| <div><h4 id="#double" /></div><a name="double" /> double |  | double | double | float |
| <div><h4 id="#float" /></div><a name="float" /> float |  | float | float | float |
| <div><h4 id="#int32" /></div><a name="int32" /> int32 | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint32 instead. | int32 | int | int |
| <div><h4 id="#int64" /></div><a name="int64" /> int64 | Uses variable-length encoding. Inefficient for encoding negative numbers – if your field is likely to have negative values, use sint64 instead. | int64 | long | int/long |
| <div><h4 id="#uint32" /></div><a name="uint32" /> uint32 | Uses variable-length encoding. | uint32 | int | int/long |
| <div><h4 id="#uint64" /></div><a name="uint64" /> uint64 | Uses variable-length encoding. | uint64 | long | int/long |
| <div><h4 id="#sint32" /></div><a name="sint32" /> sint32 | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int32s. | int32 | int | int |
| <div><h4 id="#sint64" /></div><a name="sint64" /> sint64 | Uses variable-length encoding. Signed int value. These more efficiently encode negative numbers than regular int64s. | int64 | long | int/long |
| <div><h4 id="#fixed32" /></div><a name="fixed32" /> fixed32 | Always four bytes. More efficient than uint32 if values are often greater than 2^28. | uint32 | int | int |
| <div><h4 id="#fixed64" /></div><a name="fixed64" /> fixed64 | Always eight bytes. More efficient than uint64 if values are often greater than 2^56. | uint64 | long | int/long |
| <div><h4 id="#sfixed32" /></div><a name="sfixed32" /> sfixed32 | Always four bytes. | int32 | int | int |
| <div><h4 id="#sfixed64" /></div><a name="sfixed64" /> sfixed64 | Always eight bytes. | int64 | long | int/long |
| <div><h4 id="#bool" /></div><a name="bool" /> bool |  | bool | boolean | boolean |
| <div><h4 id="#string" /></div><a name="string" /> string | A string must always contain UTF-8 encoded or 7-bit ASCII text. | string | String | str/unicode |
| <div><h4 id="#bytes" /></div><a name="bytes" /> bytes | May contain any arbitrary sequence of bytes. | string | ByteString | str |
