## ModemService
The core of the Hiber system, modems are the network nodes that send information and user data.
This service contains calls to list and manage them, as well as list their messages.

### Get
> **rpc** Get([GetModemRequest](#getmodemrequest))
    [Modem](#modem)

Get a single modem.

### Create
> **rpc** Create([CreateModem.Request](#createmodemrequest))
    [CreateModem.Response](#createmodemresponse)

Create new modem(s). This is only available if your organization can create modems.

### ListModemsGrouped

Lists all modems the given criteria, grouped by gateway.
Pagination is applied to modems in a group, not to the groups themselves.


### ListModemsGrouped.Request

The usage of ListModemsRequest and ListModemsRequest.Response in the Response.Group was intentionally
chosen to simplify pagination withing a group, since the response contains the request
(which will be updated with the group it is in) and pagination to select the next page using the
list method.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| group_content | [ ListModemsRequest](#listmodemsrequest) | The modems you want to display in the groups. This is a ListModemsRequest that is used to fetch the modems for each group, with the added limitation that the modems must be in the group. |
| groups | [ ListModemsRequest](#listmodemsrequest) | Select the parents for the groups to display. Anything selected here that cannot have any connected modems (i.e. a direct modem) wil be omitted unless allow_any_group_parent is set to true. Only gateways will have connected devices, so unless allow_any_group_parent is true, type is replaced with GATEWAY. This may change in the future if more grouping options are introduced. |
|  **optional** allow_any_group_parent | [optional bool](#bool) | Set to true to allow group request to return modems that can never be the parent of a group. - If this flag is false, the modems for the groups are automatically filtered on being a parent of a group. Note that the group may still be empty, i.e. when a gateway has no connected devices. - If this flag is true, the group parents can include modems which cannot be a parent and for which the group can only be empty. |

### ListModemsGrouped.Response

The usage of ListModemsRequest and ListModemsRequest.Response in the Response.Group was intentionally
chosen to simplify pagination withing a group, since the response contains the request
(which will be updated with the group it is in) and pagination to select the next page using the
list method.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| groups | [repeated ListModemsRequest.Response](#listmodemsrequestresponse) | The groups, based on a parent (typically a gateway unless allow_any_group_parent was set). This is a ListModemsRequest.Response, with the selection updated with its parent and includes the group parent in the group_parents field. |
| request | [ ListModemsGrouped.Request](#listmodemsgroupedrequest) |  |
| pagination | [ hiber.Pagination.Result](#hiberpaginationresult) |  |

## Referenced messages from health.proto
(Note that these are included because there is a proto dependency on the file,
so not all messages listed here are referenced.)

#### This section was generated from [health.proto](https://github.com/HiberGlobal/api/blob/master/health.proto).


### hiber.health.HealthLevel

A health level in an organization.
Health can be customized depending on your need.

The default health levels are:
- OK (green): no problems detected
- WARNING (orange): unresolvable problems detected, for example delayed or skipped messages
- ERROR (red): significant problems detected (that typically can be resolved),
  for example inactivity or invalid messages (resolved on a successful message)

Health levels can be customized to as many as you need for your operations, for example:
- INTERVENTION
- DEFECT
- BATTERY
- HIGH
- LOW

Health levels are ordered by severity (low to high),
and of all things affecting a modem's health,
only the most severe level will be returned when retrieving a modem.

Health can be assigned using modems alarms, which specify the health level they will cause on a modem (and for how
long, if it does not resolve automatically).

Precisely one health level can be assigned as a catch-all for any unknown health levels from alarms (or Hiber systems),
which can happen when a device manufacturer has provided alarms to your device (e.g. a low battery alarm).
By default, any unknown health levels map to the level that is marked catch-all.

Health level have a set of named colors, represented by a map where the key is the name of the color
and the value is a string that represents a valid CSS3 color.
Simple examples are: green, red, orange, grey, #FF00FF for fuchsia, etc (Keep in mind that CSS3 allows for many
ways to define colors, see https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-color-20030214/).

All the following definitions also mean "red":
 - rgb(255, 0, 0)
 - rgb(100%, 0, 0)
 - rgba(100%, 0%, 0%, 100%)
 - hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
 - hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 1)

The client is responsible for rendering the correct color from the CSS3 color-space and for setting the colors and
their names. There is no verification on missing named colors, so the client must set sensible defaults when colors
are missing.

To assist with sorting, health levels have a numeric severity equal to their index in the sorted list of health
levels (starting at 1). This means higher numbers denote a more severe health.
Since these values are noting more than a list index, they should not be cached, compared to another organization or
compared to values retrieved from the API at another time.

For example, an organization using the default health would have:
- Ok: severity 1
- Warning: severity 2
- Error: severity 3

That organization could then add a new health level in between Ok and Warning, meaning the severity of Warning and
Error will change:
- Ok, severity 1
- ItsComplicated, severity 2
- Warning, severity 3
- Error, severity 4

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| level | [ string](#string) | The name of this health level. Levels are identified by their name. The API does support renaming, where the rename is propagated to all the relevant parts of the system. |
| color | [ string](#string) | <strong>Deprecated.</strong> Default color for the health level, as a string that represents a valid CSS3 color. DEPRECATED: Maps to the color named "text" in color_data. |
| color_data | [map hiber.health.HealthLevel.ColorDataEntry](#hiberhealthhealthlevelcolordataentry) | Map of named colors, where key is the name and the value is a valid CSS3 color definition. |
| severity | [ int64](#int64) | A unique numeric value equal to the index of this health level in the list of health levels sorted by ascending severity (starting at 1). This means higher numbers denote a more severe health. This value cannot be used when creating or updating. To change the severity for a health level, reorder all health levels. |
| catch_all | [ bool](#bool) | Precisely one health level can be assigned as a catch-all for any unknown health levels from alarms (or Hiber systems), which can happen when a device manufacturer has provided alarms for your device (e.g. a low battery alarm). By default, unknown health levels map to the level of the highest severity, unless another level is marked as catch-all. |

### hiber.BytesOrHex

Some clients may prefer direct binary data, while other prefer a hexadecimal string,
both for input and output. To support both methods, this object is used to represent binary data.

When you receive this from the api, both fields are set. When sending it to the api, only one field is required.

### hiber.Date

Date type for convenience.

Some clients are better at parsing year, month and day of month as separate fields,
while others prefer a text-based format.
To accommodate this, this Date type supports both.

When used as API output, both the int fields and textual fields will be set.
The textual field has the commonly used ISO 8601 local date format (i.e. "2018-01-01").
When used an API input, either specify the int fields or the textual field.
If both are specified, the textual field will be discarded.

"Exclude" fields filter out anything in the exclude set.
When combined with include, exclude takes precedence when determining whether an item is filtered


### hiber.Filter.ChildOrganizations

Specify which organizations to get data from. By default, data is only retrieved for the current organization,
but using ChildOrganizations we can specify to include a number of, or all, sub-organizations.

### hiber.LocationSelection

Selection object for map data.

Also, filter the map data by level and area restriction, to only display a small area at a detailed map level,
for example

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| areas | [repeated hiber.Area](#hiberarea) | Rectangular areas, each defined by two locations, normalized to bottom-left and top-right points. |
| shapes | [repeated hiber.Shape](#hibershape) | Polygon shapes, each defined by a list of locations, which draw a shape on the map. |

### hiber.MapFilter

Some properties are stored as a name-value pair (e.g. bluetooth: 4.0, bluetooth: BLE).
This filter allows selecting a range of values for a specific name.
One could imagine wanting to include "all devices with bluetooth 4.0 or 4.1".

To select for multiple versions of a property,
add the name of the property as a map-key and add a repeated list of versions as the map-value.

For example:
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }
    returns all items that have any version of bluetooth,
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ '4.0', '5.0' ] }
    will only return items that have bluetooth version 4.0 _or_ 5.0 (inclusive or),
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ '' ] }
    would only select bluetooth peripherals that don't have any version set,
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ], 'LoRaWAN' -> [ ] }
    will only select items that have both bluetooth (any version) _and_ LoRaWAN (any version),
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }, exclude { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }
    will return an empty list since exclude will take precedence, and
- include { 'bluetooth' -> [ ] }, exclude { 'bluetooth' -> [ '3.0' ] }
    returns only items that have bluetooth, but not version 3.0.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| include_and | [map hiber.MapFilter.IncludeAndEntry](#hibermapfilterincludeandentry) | Filter to only include items with all of the given set of properties. |
| exclude | [map hiber.MapFilter.ExcludeEntry](#hibermapfilterexcludeentry) | Filter to exclude items with any of the given set of properties. |

which is not possible in protobuf without trickery.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| value | [repeated string](#string) |  |

### hiber.Pagination

Pagination is normalized across the api. Provide a pagination object to get a specific page or offset,
or limit your data.

Calls that have a pagination option automatically return a Pagination.Result, which contains
either the specified pagination options or the defaults, as well as total counts. It also contains Pagination
objects that can be used for the previous and next page.

This effectively means that an api user would never need to create their own pagination object; as long as they
start at the first page and continue to the next, they can use the provided Pagination object.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **optional** size | [optional int32](#int32) |  |
|  **optional** page | [optional int32](#int32) |  |

### hiber.Pagination.Result



| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| size | [ int32](#int32) |  |
| page | [ int32](#int32) |  |
| total | [ int32](#int32) |  |
| total_pages | [ int32](#int32) |  |
| previous | [ hiber.Pagination](#hiberpagination) |  |
| next | [ hiber.Pagination](#hiberpagination) |  |
| approximated_total | [ bool](#bool) | Indicates that the total is an approximation, and not an exact value. This can be set for data that changes often, or is generally only fetched in an infinite scrolling manner. For example, unbundled events are likely to return an approximated total, but not guaranteed to do so. |

### hiber.Shape

Polygon shape defined by a list of locations, which draw a shape on the map.
The last point is connected to the first to close the shape.

For example, the outline of a city would be defined using a Shape,
while a rectangular region is easier to define using Area.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| path | [repeated hiber.Location](#hiberlocation) |  |
|  **optional** textual | [optional string](#string) | Text representation. Can be used as an alternative input in a request, filled in by the API in responses. |

### hiber.TimeRange

Period of time between two timestamps. Typically used for filtering.

This can be used with textual shortcuts for timestamp, and some additional duration textual shortcuts:
- a duration as an offset of now, i.e. "-10h" or "PT-10h": converted to now + offset, so start.textual -10h is
  10 hours before the end time (using the ISO 8601 duration format)
Examples:
- start "-10h" end "now": a time range from 10 hours before the request time, to the request time
- start "-10h" end "2022-01-01 20:00": becomes start 2022-01-01 10:00 end 2022-01-01 20:00

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| start | [ hiber.Timestamp](#hibertimestamp) |  |
| end | [ hiber.Timestamp](#hibertimestamp) |  |

### hiber.Timestamp

Timestamp type for convenience.

Some clients are better at parsing Google's seconds/nanos based timestamp, while others prefer a text-based format.
To accommodate this, this Timestamp type supports both.

When used as API output, both the timestamp and textual fields will be set. The textual field has the commonly
used ISO 8601 format (i.e. "2018-01-01T13:00:00Z").
When used an API input, only one of the fields is needed, there is no need to set both. When both are set, the
timestamp field will be used, the textual field will be discarded.

In addition, the textual field, when used as input, allows for a number of shortcuts that get converted into
timestamps:
- "now": converted to the current timestamp at the time of the request

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **optional** timestamp | [optional google.protobuf.Timestamp](#googleprotobuftimestamp) |  |
|  **optional** time_zone | [optional string](#string) |  |
|  **optional** textual | [optional string](#string) |  |

### hiber.UpdateBoolean

<strong>Deprecated.</strong> Update object for a boolean.

Since false is the default value, we need to distinguish between an omitted value and setting the value to false,
in an update object.

DEPRECATED: use alternative optional fields in the relevant places instead.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| updated | [ bool](#bool) |  |
| value | [ bool](#bool) |  |

### hiber.UpdateClearableString

Since an empty string is also the default value, we need to distinguish between an omitted value and
setting the value to an empty string, in an update object.

To use this to update, set a value and set updated to true

DEPRECATED: use alternative optional fields in the relevant places instead.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

| updated | [ bool](#bool) |  |
| value | [ int64](#int64) |  |

### hiber.UpdateZeroableInt

<strong>Deprecated.</strong> Update object for an int that can be set to 0.
